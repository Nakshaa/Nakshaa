## Keshab Thapa ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD Candidate at the Natural Resources Institute of the University of Manitoba, Canada. I have worked with Maawandoon Inc., an Indigenous consulting in Fort William First Nation, Thunder Bay, in documenting the traditional land use and occupancy and traditional ecological knowledge study with Fort William First Nation, Mishkeegogamang First Nation, and Red Sucker Lake First Nation. I use ArcGIS Pro and QGIS in my GIS mapping projects. My learning journey involves analyzing satellite imageries through remote sensing by using open source software, such as google earth engine, geemap, leafmap, and etc. and communicating information for land protection. I am keen in designing open-source packages that an eight grader can use in mapping their land and sharing their maps.
